# Weather Forecasting Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

Weather prediction is crucial in many fields with operations and protection requirements worldwide (Bag et al., 2022). In the recent past, the use of Machine learning (ML) algorithms has been implemented in the process of this forecasting with the foresight predictions being accurate. Previously, analysts utilized numerical simulations of the model to predict and this methodology rather posed some challenges in depicting pertinent aspects of the circulation in the atmosphere (Kochkov et al., 2024). Business forecasting is made accurate by machine learning because large data sets are analyzed to identify distinguishing features for prediction. Other factors that are important for the generation of the weather include humidity, pressure and clouds (Lakra and Avishek, 2022). The objective of this research is to explore the usage of ML in increasing meteorological prediction and the parameters that must be incorporated into consideration as well as the Integration of the most efficient algorithms. The increase in data access for weather data helps in enhancing refreshing and oversimplified Weather-based ML-based forecasting models for utility purposes across various sectors.

## DataSet Description
This research procedure will use a weather dataset. The dataset that was collected was from Cambridge University’s website and Kaggle . Source:- (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/weather/),  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction/data?select=weather_prediction_dataset.csv) 
This dataset consists of descriptions of meteorological variables along with both raw and Units converted forms. The other independent variables are cloud cover, abbreviated as CC in oktas, wind direction as DD in degrees, wind speed as FG and gust as FX in m/s and humidity abbreviated as HU in fraction of 100 (Kaggle, 2024). The pressure (PP) is given in 1000 hPa, global radiation (QQ) in 100 Wm², and precipitation amount (RR) in 10 mm, Sunshine duration (SS) is in hours, the mean temperature (TG) together with the minimum and maximum temperatures (TN, TX) is in °C. The present features allow for a detailed evaluation of the weather status within the atmosphere, temperature, and radiation.
